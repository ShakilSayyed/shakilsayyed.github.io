ABV is used to release the pressure that may have been created due to no other routes present for the water flow, with increase pressure noise is created in the system. If no such route is provided or pressure is not released the boiler will shut down indicating error.\nQ-4 What is a W-Plan\rIt is a hot water priority motorised valve. Note: A combination boiler uses a diverter or hot water priority motorised valve.\nQ-5 Can we install a TRV on Tower rails in bathroom ?\rNo, TRVs are not installed on tower rails. TRVs are installed in rooms to allow customer to control room temperature individually. It is not installed in a room where RST is fitted.\nQ-6 What is a boiler cycling ?\rWhen the boiler fires up and cools down and carry on doing, it is knowns as boiler cycling. Note: Boiler cycling puts a lot of stress on the boiler and used to happen in old system where not many controls were present to control the temperature. If it happens in modern boiler it is a sign that boiler is working inefficiently.\nQ- 7 What are minibore and microbore system ?\rThe term Minibore is used for R250 copper pipes which comes in sizes of 15, 22 and 28 mm pipes. They are also known as half hard straight length of copper. Note: They are also known as small bore. In majority of fully pumped system, small bore pipe is used of either 15mm and 22mm.\nThe term Microbore is used for R220 copper pipe which comes in sizes of 6-8-10 and 12 mm and used with manifolds in some central heating systems where flexibility is required, every radiator has its own loop. Q-8 Difference between permanent and temporary decommissioning ?\rTemporary decommissioning is needed when a system is worked on for a short period of time. For example replacing a part, draining the system etc. Permanent decommissioning is needed when system is being taken out of service, dismantled or stripped out. Q-9 How do you find the grade of Low Carbon Steel ?\rBy its color Grades Color Use Heavy Red Steam and fire systems Medium Blue Heating and oil lines Light Brown Gas Q-10 Which one of the gas boilers overcomes the need for a cold water storage cistern, f\u0026E cistern and hot water storage vessel ?\rCombination boiler. Q-11 When positioning a single thermostat in dwelling what is the recommended height from ground level ?\r1.5m in domestic settings Q-12 Why does a filling loop need to have a double check valve included ?\rTo protect from contaminating by category 3 water. As it connects category 1 water from category 3 water. Note: On commercial heating system a PRZ or BA ( Pressure Release valve or a back flow prevention deviceis used to protectcategory 1 from category 4` water.\nQ-13 In what system the boiler position can be higher than the hot water cylinder ?\rFully pumped sealed system. Q-14 Why do you require a filling loop in sealed system ?\rTo fill the system with water to a specific pressure. Note: It usually connects main water feed to a central heating return pipe and is fitted with EC/ED back flow prevention device known as double check valve.\nQ-15 The process of adjusting the flow rate though radiators during commissioning is called ?\rBalancing Q- 16 What is the temperature kept for central-heating and hot water system in modernized or fully pumped systems using Y-Plan ?\rCH is set to 85 degree centigrade HW is set to 60 degree centigrade Note: Irrespective of the plan used the temperature for central-heating is 85 degree Centigrade and for hot water it is 60 degree centigrade`\nQ-17 Where are motorised valves in S and Y plans are fitted ?\rThey are fitted near to the cylinder. Q-18 Which boiler only controls the heating ?\rA combi boiler Note: A combi boiler controls the heating only as the hot water is produced on demand instantly when you turn on the tap. There is no need for the cylinder to store the hot water thereby no control over hot water.\nQ-19 If a property is over 150 square meter which plan is best suited ?\rS-Plan plus Note: It incorporates the needs of an external zone when a property is more than 150 square meter.\nQ-20 In sealed system what else is required to accommodate water expansion other than expansion vessel ?\rA PRV will need to be installed. Note: This allows the system to discharge pressure to a safe location if required.\nQ-21 Which two pipes should not contain any valve in vented central-heating system ?\rA cold feed pipe A vent pipe Note: t is the cold feed pipe coming from the F\u0026amp;E cistern to the boiler. it is to make sure that in case of overheating there is a constant supply of cooler water to the system to prevent the dangerous condition of boiling. Similarly a vent pipe should also not contain any valve at all ( service valve or isolation valve ), and it must rise 450mm above the water level to ensure that the system must remain at atmospheric pressure limiting the temperature to 100 degree C.\nQ-22 Which boilers supply hot water indirectly ?\rTraditional and regular boilers They supply hot water indirectly via a hot water storage cylinder as compared to combi boiler which supply hot water directly.\nQ-24 Under Building Regulation Part L which boilers can be fitted ?\rOnly SEDBUK ( Seasonal Efficiency of a Domestic Boiler in UK ) rated A condensing boiler can be fitted. Q-25 Identify one advantage of underfloor heating\rEven spread of heat. Q-26 At what pressure is a pressure relief valve on a combination boiler normally set to discharge ?\r3 bar Q-27 Where should be an air vent be installed in hot water system ?\rAt the highest point in system Q-28 What does part J document covers ?\rHeat producing appliances such as boilers Q-29 What is the draw back of radiator without fins ?\rHeat is not convected evenly in the room Note: Without fins, heat is not convected evenly in the room and leaves the cold patches. It is these fins that traps the air which is convected in the room. Due to having fins 70 heat is convected\nQ-30 What is church or hospital radiators ?\rColumn radiators Note: Church or Hospital radiator were the name given to column radiators because they were installed in these places, they take lot of water and take longer to warm up.\nQ-31 Which radiators are installed in places where vulnerable people are present ?\rLow Surface temperature radiators Q-32 What document says that radiators installed on vulnerable places should not have surface temperature more than 43 degree centigrade ?\rHSE Health and Safety information sheet no 6. Q-33 Radiators technical specification , testing and rating is controlled by what standard ?\rBS EN 4421 Q-34 Which is more efficient system sealed or vented ?\rSealed system It is quicker to heat up the dwellings but both are same when it comes to measure energy efficiency\nQ-35 Why a system called open vented ?\rOpen vented refers to the separate vent pipe which is open to the atmospheric pressure.
